Detcecting Blobs in Images 

Build a system for detecting Blobs in the image using Laplacian of Gaussian Filter. Applied this filter at different scale space on the image starting with some initial value and increasing it by factor K going upto N iterations. Performed nonmaximum suppression in scale space. Resulting blobs were then displayed at their characteristic scales.
